These mappings are best suited for people who also have head tracking.

To load these keybindings copy layout_x320X-56_exported.xml and paste it in your
StarCitizen\LIVE\USER\Client\0\Controls\Mappings folder. Load up star citizen and
go to your options -> keybindnigs tab then click on control profiles and select
320X-56 and match the first joystick device profile with 1: Saitek pro flight..
 and match the second joystick device profile with 2: Saitek pro flight x-5...
I have a few m&kb changes but those are optional and you can leave those blank.
Select the Load to load in the profile.
In addition to loading the control profile go to the controls tab and make the
following modifications:
